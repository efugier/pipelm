# smartcat (sc)

Puts a brain behind `cat`! CLI interface to bring language models in the Unix ecosystem and allow power users to make the most out of llms.

What makes it special:
- made for power users;
- minimalist, built following to the unix philosophy with terminal and editor intergation in mind;
- good io handling to insert user input in prompts and use the result in cli-based workflows;
- built-in partial prompt to make the model play nice as a cli tool;
- full configurability on which API, LLM version and temperature you use;
- write and save your own prompt templates for faster reccuring tasks (simplify, optimize, tests, etc);
- conversation support;
- glob expressions to include context files.

Currently supports **OpenAi**, **Mistral AI** and **Anthropic** APIs.

## Installation


### With Cargo

With an **up to date** [rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) setup (you might consider running `rustup update`):

```
cargo install smartcat
```

run this command again to update `smartcat`.

### By downloading the binary

Chose the one compiled for your platform on the [release page](https://github.com/efugier/smartcat/releases).

(the binary is named `sc`)

---

On the first run, `smartcat` will ask you to generate some default configuration files if it cannot find them.
More about that in the [configuration section](#Configuration).

A `default` prompt is needed for `smartcat` to know which api and model to hit.

## Usage

```text
Usage: sc [OPTIONS] [CONFIG_PROMPT]

Arguments:
  [CONFIG_PROMPT]  which prompt in the config to fetch [default: default]

Options:
  -i, --input <INPUT>
          skip reading from stdin and use that value instead
  -p, --custom-prompt <CUSTOM_PROMPT>
          custom prompt to append before the input
  -e, --extend-conversation
          whether to extend the previous conversation or start a new one
  -r, --repeat-input
          whether to repeat the input before the output, useful to extend instead of replacing
  -c, --context <CONTEXT>
          glob pattern to given the matched files' content as context
  -s, --system-message <SYSTEM_MESSAGE>
          system "config"  message to send after the prompt and before the first user message
  -a, --after-input <AFTER_INPUT>
          suffix to add after the input and the custom prompt
  -f, --file <FILE>
          skip reading from the input and read this file instead
  -t, --temperature <TEMPERATURE>
          temperature between 0 and 2, higher means answer further from the average
      --api <API>
          overrides which api to hit [possible values: openai, mistral, another-api-for-tests]
  -m, --model <MODEL>
          overrides which model (of the api) to use
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```

You can use it to **accomplish tasks in the CLI** but **also in your editors** (if they are good unix citizens, i.e. work with shell commands and text streams) to complete, refactor, write tests... anything!

The key to make this work seamlessly is a good default prompt that tells the model to behave like a CLI tool an not write any unwanted text like markdown formatting or explanations.

## A few examples to get started üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

Ask anything without leaving the confort of your terminal! Use the `-i` flag so that it doesn't wait for piped input.

```
sc -i "write an overview of this project's usage" -c "src/**/*.rs"
```
> _This project is a smart version of the Unix cat command. It takes text and a prompt, then outputs text according to specifications. The output is clean and ready for further processing by other programs, making it useful for precise text control in toolchains or workflow automation._

```
sc -i "sed command to remove trailaing whitespaces at the end of all non-markdown files?"
sed -i '' 's/[ \t]*$//' *.* !(*.md)
```

continue the last conversation use `-e`

```
sc -e -i "and using awk?"
awk '{ sub(/[ \t]+$/, ""); print }' file.ext > file.tmp && mv file.tmp file.ext
```

```
sc -i "shell script to migrate a repository from pipenv to poetry" >> poetry_mirgation.sh
```

get another opinion

```
sc -i "shell script to migrate a repository from pipenv to poetry" --api mistral >> poetry_mirgation_mistral.sh
```

### Manipulate file and text streams

```
cat Cargo.toml | sc -p "write a short poem about the content of the file"

A file named package,
Holds the keys of a software's age.
With a name, version, and edition too,
The content speaks of something new.
[...]
```

```
sc -f Cargo.toml -p "translate the following file in json" >> save Cargo.json
```

```
cat my_stuff.py | \
sc -p "write a parametrized test suite for the following code using pytest" \
-s "output only the code, as a standalone file with the imports. \n" \
-a "" \
> test.py
```

If you find yourself reusing prompts often, you can create a dedicated config entries and it becomes the following:

```
sc write_tests -f my_file.py > test.py
```

see example in the [configuration section](#Configuration).

### Integrating with editors

The key for a good integration in editors is a good default prompt (or set of) combined with the `-p` flag for precising the task at hand.
The `-r` flag can be used to decide whether to replace or extend the selection.

#### Vim

Start by selecting some text, then press `:`. You can then pipe the selection content to `smartcat`.

```
:'<,'>!sc -p "replace the versions with wildcards"
```

```
:'<,'>!sc -p "fix the typos in this text"
```

will **replace** the current selection with the same text transformed by the language model.

```
:'<,'>!sc -r write_test
```

will **append** at the end of the current selection the result of the language model.

#### Helix and Kakoune

Same concept, different shortcut, simply press the pipe key to redirect the selection to `smarcat`.

```
pipe:sc write_test -r
```
With some remapping you may have your most reccurrent action attached to few keystrokes e.g. `<leader>wt`!

#### Example Workflow

select a struct

```
:'<,'>!sc -r -p "implement the traits FromStr and ToString for this struct"
```

select the generated impl block

```
:'<,'>!sc -e -i "can you make it more concise?"
```

put the cursor at the bottom of the file and give example usage as input

```
:'<,'>!sc -e -p "now write tests for it knowing it's used like this" -f src/main.rs
```

...


These are only some ideas to get started, experiment for yourself!

# Configuration

- by default lives at `$HOME/.config/smartcat`
- the directory can be set using the `SMARTCAT_CONFIG_PATH` environement variable
- use `#[<input>]` as the placeholder for input when writing prompts
- the default model is `gpt-4` but I recommend trying the latest ones and see which one works best for you;
- you can play with the temperature and set a default for each prompt depending on its use case.

Three files are used:

`conversation.toml`

stores the latest chat if you need to continue it

`.api_configs.toml`

```toml
[openai]  # each supported api has their own config section with api and url
api_key = "<your_api_key>"
default_model = "gpt-4-turbo-preview"
url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

[mistral]
api_key_command = "pass mistral/api_key"  # you can use a command to grab the key
default_model = "mistral-medium"
url = "https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions"

[anthropic]
api_key = "<yet_another_api_key>"
url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages"
default_model = "claude-3-opus-20240229"
```

`prompts.toml`

```toml
[default]  # a prompt is a section
api = "openai"  # must refer to an entry in the `.api_configs.toml` file
model = "gpt-4-1106-preview"  # each prompt may define its own model

[[default.messages]]  # then you can list messages
role = "system"
content = """\

```

see [the config setup file](./src/config.rs) for more details.

## Developping

Some tests rely on environement variables and don't behave well with multi-threading. They are marked with `#[serial]` from the [serial_test](https://docs.rs/serial_test/latest/serial_test/index.html) crate.

### State of the project

Smartcat has reached an acceptable feature set. The focus is now on upgrading the codebase quality as I hadn't really touched rust since 2019 and it shows.

#### TODO

- [ ] make it available on homebrew
- [ ] automatically context fetches
- [ ] split the config file into several, it's way too big
